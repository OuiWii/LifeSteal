## About The Project

I made this plugin for me and my friends but realized I could publish it so others may use it. It is based on the LifeSteal SMP. For those of you who don't know, that's a private Minecraft server where when you get killed you lose one heart and your killer gains 1 heart. You can also craft the hearts.

## Built With

I used these projects to make the plugin:

* [Spigot API](https://www.spigotmc.org/)
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)

## Getting Started

The plugin is very easy to download and install, it requires no setup.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need a Spigot compatible server, that's all.

### Installation

1. Download the <a href="https://github.com/OuiWii/LifeSteal/releases">latest release</a>
2. Put the .jar file in your plugins/ folder.
3. You're done!
